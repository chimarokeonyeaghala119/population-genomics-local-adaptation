# population-genomics-local-adaptation
Analysis workflows for population genomic data from microbial populations evolved in structureed environments to infer selection, adaptive divergence, gene flow, and local adaptation. 
The genomic data were initially analyzed using Breseq software by mapping raw reads to a reference genome and identifying unique mutations in the populations
